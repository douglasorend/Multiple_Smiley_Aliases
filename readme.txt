[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows an adminstrator to add a single or multiple aliases to each smiley.  Each smiley alias functions the same as the original.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
In [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Forum[/b] -> [b]Smileys and Message Icons[/b] -> [b]Edit Smileys[/b], the list has been altered to show the alias(es) per smiley.  The [b]Modify[/b] screen has a new line called [b]Aliases[/b] with input boxes to enter the aliases into, as well as a [b]Add Code[/b] button to add another alias to this smiley.
